# Data Analysis on Crop-Production-of-India

# Objective:
To analyze crop production data from various states and districts in India, identify key trends related to crop yields and areas, and assess variations across seasons and crop types.

# Tools Used
Ms Excel- Data Collection and export of CSV as DB,
Dataset was collected from https://data.world/thatzprem/agriculture-india
My SQL Workbench- Data Analysis
MS PowerBI- Data Visualization

# Summary:
The dataset comprises 246,091 entries related to crop production in India, covering the years 2000 onwards. It contains information on the state, district, crop year, season, crop type, area cultivated, and production yield. Missing values exist for production in some entries. The data offers an opportunity to study patterns in agricultural output across different regions and seasons, offering insights into productivity, crop distribution, and seasonal impacts on farming outcomes.

# Key Insights
1. Geographic Variation: Significant differences in crop production across various states and districts.
2. Seasonal Impact: Different crop yields are associated with seasons like Kharif, Rabi, and Whole Year farming.
3. Crop-wise Production: Certain crops like Rice and Wheat dominate production, while others show region-specific cultivation.
4. Missing Production Data: About 3,730 entries lack production data, which may require imputation or careful handling in the analysis.

# Conclusion:
This dataset provides a comprehensive look at Indian agriculture and will help derive insights into crop productivity and area efficiency trends across the country.
